           Comet Desktop v2 - Extjs Web Desktop
-------------------------------------------------------------
http://github.com/xantus/comet-desktop


This version is completely rewritten!  The backend is Mojo
which has no other requirements other than Perl 5.8.1+
Mojo has a built-in web server, and supports CGI, and FastCGI

Comet Desktop can run on almost anything, including Windows!
(we dev on linux, so report any win32 issues :>)

To start the event bus

./bin/event-bus

To start the flash policy server (for the flash based websocket)

./bin/flash-policy-server


To start the http server:

./run

CGI, and FastCGI will be covered later when the code is more
mature.
